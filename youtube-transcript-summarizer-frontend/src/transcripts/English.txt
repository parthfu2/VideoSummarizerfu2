But what if emma skips this step she might end up choosing the wrong variables which will produce an inaccurate model thus exploratory data analysis becomes the most important step now she proceeds to the core activity of a data science project which is data modeling she repetitively applies diverse machine learning techniques like knn decision tree knife base to the data to identify the model that best fits the business requirement she trains the models on the training data set and test them to select the best performing model emma prefers python for modeling the data however it can also be done using r and sas well the trickiest part is not yet over visualization and communication emma meets the clients again to communicate the business findings in a simple and effective manner to convince the stakeholders she uses tools like tableau power bi and qlikview that can help her in creating powerful reports and dashboards and then finally she deploys and maintains the model she tests the selected model in a pre-production environment before deploying it in the production environment which is the best practice right after successfully deploying it she uses reports and dashboards to get real-time analytics further she also monitors and maintains the project's performance well that's how emma completes the data science project we have seen the daily routine of a data scientist is a whole lot of fun has a lot of interesting aspects and comes with its own share of challenges now let's see how data science is changing the world data science techniques along with genomic data provides a deeper understanding of genetic issues and reaction to particular drugs and diseases logistic companies like dhl fedex have discovered the best rules to ship the best suited time to deliver the best mode of transport to choose thus leading to cost efficiency with data science it is possible to not only predict employee attrition but to also understand the key variables that influence employee turnover also the airline companies can now easily predict flight delay and notify the passengers beforehand to enhance their travel experience well if you're wondering there are various roles offered to .
